The dataset included 6 features that could determine whether a car's evaluation is unacceptable, acceptable, good, or very good. I tried to see whether I could create a model that could predict a car's evaluation based on the 6 features better than the base model.

Used Python, the sci-kit learn library, with techniques such as decision trees, random forests, AdaBoost classifier, undersampling, and oversampling.
